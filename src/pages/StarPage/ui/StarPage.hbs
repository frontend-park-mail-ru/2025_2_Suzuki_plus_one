                        Matthew David McConaughey is an American
                        actor. He achieved his breakthrough with a supporting performance in the coming-of-age
                        comedy Dazed and Confused (1993). After a number of supporting roles, his first success
                        as a
                        leading man came in the legal drama A Time to Kill (1996). His career progressed with
                        lead
                        roles in the science fiction film Contact (1997), the historical drama Amistad (1997),
                        and
                        the war film U-571 (2000).

                        In the 2000s, McConaughey became known for starring in romantic comedies, including The
                        Wedding Planner (2001), How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), Failure to Launch (2006),
                        Fool's Gold (2008), and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009), establishing him as a sex
                        symbol.
                        In 2011, after a two-year hiatus from film acting, McConaughey began to appear in more
                        dramatic roles, beginning with the legal drama The Lincoln Lawyer. In 2012, he gained
                        wider
                        praise for his roles as a stripper in Magic Mike and a fugitive in Mud.

                        McConaughey's portrayal of Ron Woodroof, a cowboy diagnosed with AIDS, in the biopic
                        Dallas
                        Buyers Club (2013) earned him widespread critical acclaim and numerous accolades,
                        including
                        the Academy Award for Best Actor. He followed it with a supporting role in The Wolf of
                        Wall
                        Street (2013), and a starring role as Rust Cohle in the first season of HBO's crime
                        anthology series True Detective (2014), for which he was nominated for the Primetime
                        Emmy
                        Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. His subsequent film roles include
                        starring in Interstellar (2014) and The Gentlemen (2019), as well as voice work in Kubo
                        and
